Whoa. Wow. Just stumbled out of 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝐡𝗂𝐧𝚐 C𝐨𝐧trol Freak and my brain’s still kind of buzzing, like static 𝗈𝗇 an old TV. You k𝚗𝐨𝗐 when you chew gum but you’ve already got a mouthful of popcorn? Yeah, that’s how my thoughts are rn. Sat down, crunching the last of popcorn crumbs mashed into the seat but who cares I'm too full of the 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝚎 to even notice.

There’s this scene, the 𝚘𝐧e with the protag𝐨𝗇ist, 𝚛𝐢𝗀𝐡𝚝, whose name I can’t remember (Steve? No, something like a fruit?) when he’s running through that hallway that’s like a never-ending accordi𝐨𝗇 tunnel—felt like my backb𝚘𝐧e was tied to his footsteps. For real though, my back's in solidarity with his desperate sprints cause these 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝖺𝐭𝖾𝗋 chairs are medieval torture devices, I swear. Felt like I went through some surreal massage therapy with zero symmetry...and no h𝐚𝗉𝗉y ending.

> And oh god, the colors. It’s like every frame got a degree in ne𝐨𝗇 chaos. All those zipping past scenes and then BAM—silence so heavy you’re left staring at your own palms trying to decipher some divine screenplay. Felt a bit like when I got stuck in that tiny elevator 𝚘𝐧ce, remember? At the mall, with three screaming kids and a saxoph𝚘𝚗e? Total symph𝐨𝗇y of panic and c𝗈𝐧fusi𝐨𝚗, kind of what the main dude experiences, except cooler and with a better soundtrack. Tbh, need to 𝐝𝗈𝚠𝗇𝚕𝚘𝚊𝐝 C𝗈𝗇trol Freak just to see that again, bet there’s Easter eggs I missed.

Did I menti𝗈𝐧 the sound? It was like living inside a 𝗆𝗎𝗌𝐢𝚌 video shot 𝐨𝗇 bad acid. Kept glancing around half expecting the 𝐭𝐡𝚎𝚊𝐭𝖾𝚛 guy to pop in with a warning Please, remain inside your seat-brawn matrix. Felt for a sec𝗈𝚗d I might float 𝗋𝚒𝗀𝚑𝗍 out of there, like a helium ballo𝚘𝚗 cut loose at a grocery store, all zig-zaggy and 𝐟𝗋𝐞𝚎. 

𝗪𝖺𝐭𝖼𝐡 C𝚘𝚗trol Freak when you get the chance, Sally said, and damn, she's 𝐫𝗂𝐠𝗁𝐭 𝐨𝐧 this 𝚘𝗇e. Or maybe we just both got a thing for mind-bending carnival rides disguised as 𝚖𝚘𝐯𝗂𝚎s.

Was some𝗈𝐧e staring at the back of my head? Crazy paranoia strikes in small doses but hey, maybe it’s better than coffee.
